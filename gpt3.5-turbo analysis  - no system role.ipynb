Increased CO2 concentrations trap more heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in temperature. This mechanism supports the idea that changing local CO2 flux can cause a change in temperature.\\n\\nOn the other hand, temperature changes can also affect CO2 flux through various processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and solubility of CO2 in water bodies.

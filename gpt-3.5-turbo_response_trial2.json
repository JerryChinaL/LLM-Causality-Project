Common sense: We can also use our common sense and general knowledge to evaluate the likelihood of each relationship.\n\nBased on these considerations, it is more likely that changing precipitation causes a change in longitude rather than the other way around. Precipitation patterns, such as rainfall or snowfall, are influenced by various factors such as temperature, air pressure, and humidity. These factors can vary across different regions, leading to variations in precipitation. These variations in precipitation can then affect the overall climate and weather patterns, including changes in longitude.\n\nOn the other hand, changing longitude itself does not directly influence precipitation. Longitude is a measure of the east-west position on the Earth's surface and does not have a direct impact on weather patterns or precipitation.
